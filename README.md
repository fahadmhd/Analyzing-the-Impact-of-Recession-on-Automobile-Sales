### Introduction
This project analyzes the historical trends in automobile sales during various recession periods. By examining various factors such as GDP, Unemployment Rate, Consumer Confidence, and more, we aim to gain insights into how recessions impacted automobile sales.

### Objectives
* Create informative and visually appealing plots with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Dash.
* Analyze data to uncover insights on the impact of recessions on automobile sales.
* Understand the correlation between different economic indicators and their effect on sales.
### Data Description
The dataset contains historical automobile sales data, representing sales and related variables during recession and non-recession periods. The key columns include:
